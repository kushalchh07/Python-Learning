# Generators in Python What Are Generators?
#In Python, a generator is a type of iterator that is defined like a regular
# function but uses the yield keyword instead of return to produce a series of
# values. Each time the generatorâ€™s yield is executed, it "pauses" and saves its state.
# When you call the generator again, it resumes from where it left off.
def simple_generator():
    """
    A simple generator that yields the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in that order.

    Yields:
        int: The next number in the sequence (1, 2, 3).

    Examples:
        >>> for i in simple_generator():
        ...     print(i)
        1
        2
        3
    """
    
    
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

for i in simple_generator():
    print(i)

    #Summary of Key Points
    '''
    yield creates a generator function that returns an iterator.
next() can be used to fetch the next item from the generator.
Generators are memory-efficient and support lazy evaluation.
They are ideal for working with large data streams or infinite sequences.
